#Lets take another step
#1. The program will ask us what is your name with a command named input
#2  It will store the name we entered into variable called vname. This is a little box storing the value for later use
#3  At the last step the program will return nice greeting using varible vname.
vname = input('What is your name? ')   #ask about a name and store it to variable
print("Hello " + vname)              #as you can see we are using print command from previous lesson
